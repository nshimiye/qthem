When you are in a conversation and want to refer to a news report that you've listened to, sometimes it becomes hard to remember what a person said exactly.

So QThem is hear to help you not only remember what was said, but brings confidence in you that what you say is the actual words of the speaker.

Security and Privacy

We use Parse.com to store the data and this platform offer security for the stored data.
A user has full controll over thier quotes and no one can access them unless the owner allows it.


Abuse
=====

Any reported quote has to have a legitimate source(CNN, BBC, New York Times ...), otherwise, it will not be published to the public.
